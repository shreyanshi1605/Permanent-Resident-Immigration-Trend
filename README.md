### 🎉 **Exploring Canada's PR Immigration Trends with Power BI! 🇨🇦**

I am excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard, which provides a comprehensive analysis of Permanent Residency (PR) immigration trends in Canada from 2015 to 2024. This project dives deep into the data, offering valuable insights and answering key questions about immigration patterns and their implications.

*Key Questions:*

1. How have global events like COVID-19 impacted immigration trends?
2. Which provinces have the highest growth rates in permanent residents?
3. What are the most successful immigration programs in terms of numbers?
4. What is the trend of Canadian immigration after the introduction of express entry in 2015?
5. What is the projected number of permanent residents for the next 5 years?

📊 *Key Insights from the Dashboard:*

🔍 **Impact of Global Events:** COVID-19 significantly reduced immigration numbers by 50% in 2020 due to travel restrictions and processing delays.

🏞️ **Provincial Growth Rates:** Ontario (1.2M) and Quebec (0.8M) lead in the number of permanent residents, showcasing the highest growth rates.

🛂 **Successful Immigration Programs:** The Provincial Nominee Program (561K) and Skilled Worker category (548K) are the most successful in terms of numbers.

📈 **Post-Express Entry Trends:** Since the introduction of Express Entry in 2015, there has been a steady upward trend, with numbers rising from 200K in 2015 to 500K in 2023.

🔮 **Future Projections:** The forecast indicates a continuous increase, reaching approximately 5.5M permanent residents by 2028.

🌐 **Geographical Insights:** Even though Nunavut covers 21% of Canada, it only has 45 PR residents, highlighting significant regional disparities.

🤝 **Refugee Programs:** Privately Sponsored Refugees (146K) outnumber Government Sponsored Refugees (121K), showcasing the impact of private sponsorship programs.

🛠️ *Project Workflow:*

- **Data Preprocessing:** Unmerged columns, combined year and month rows, and removed quarterly fields for cleaner data.
- **Data Analysis with Python:** Used the melt function to reformat the data for better analysis.
- **Power BI Visualization:** Created dynamic and interactive charts, including line charts for trends, bar charts for categories, and tree maps for provincial distributions.
